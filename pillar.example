  lookup:
    # Customize dnsmasq settings below - any valid dnsmasq configuration file
    # parameter may be included. One setting per line.
    #
    # Note that on/off settings are handled differently. If the option does not
    # appear in the config file, it is disabled. If it does appear, the option is
    # enabled. To enable an option, set it to "True". For example:
    #     domain-needed: True
    #
    # Options which may be listed multiple times in the configuration file
    # (e.g., interface) must be passed as lists.
    #
    settings:
      # Port to listen on. Setting this to zero completely disables DNS function,
      # leaving only DHCP and/or TFTP.
      port: 53

      # Listen only on the eth1 and lo interfaces
      interface:
        - eth1
        - lo

      # Require full domain name? (including a dot and domain part)
      domain-needed: True
      # Never forward addresses in the non-routed address spaces?
      bogus-priv: True

    # Add extra entries to the DNS or override existing ones
    # (e.g. for split horizon usage)
    # The domain will automatically be appended if its part of a mapping
    # It is recommended to group common domains in a mapping to prevent
    # duplicated names in Pillar and to make it easier to manage.

    # Similarly to hosts this can deal with single and multiple entries in the
    # form of source: target.
    # Please note that this _only_ works for targets that are in the DHCP or
